# WHS Vote

This is WHS Vote, an app developed for Whitney High School to use for school-wide voting events with the goal of providing a mobile-based outlet to increase student participation in WHS elections. Although very much still in progress, the site will eventually support ID and birthdate verification for student voting, uploading of student data through CSV or Excel files, and a powerful backend where administrators are able to upload physical votes.

Eventually this project will (hopefully) be extended to other schools to provide a free, open-source application to cleanly and efficiently provide an online voting system.
